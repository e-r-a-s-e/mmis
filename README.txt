e r a s e's scripts

This is a dumping ground of one file scripts to do various things. Why? cause i like coding but only know how to do primitive shit.

These have only been tested on Debian 11, they will most likely work on Debian-based systems but I have not tested.
----------
convert-audio.sh -- script that can convert single or multiple audio files without needing to know how to use ffmpeg
makemkv-install.sh -- MakeMKV Install Script

TODO: Make it a bit more complex by having it decide what system it is so it knows what dependencies to download.
